## Description

## Roles

#### Andrew Barba
Andrew was responsible for architecting the game. Proper object-oriented design, clean code and documentation were an important design goal of the project along with, of course, a compiling and working version of the code. Thorough testing of the code was done before ever running on a ZedBoard. Andrew simulated the moving paddle using the right and left arrow keys and a variety of board and paddle configurations. Since time with the ZedBoard and Wii remote could be limited due to a large number of groups working on final projects, we needed the confidence that we had a working game and could just focus on the hardware components when we were in the lab.

#### Hardik Kapoor
Hardik was responsible for the Wii remote connection setup and scripts so we could quickly and reliably connect the remote to the ZedBoard and begin testing our code. Hardik also filmed and edited the final version of our video that is linked below.
